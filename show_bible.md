## Show Identity

### Purpose
We create smart, character-driven sketch comedy that finds humor in everyday absurdity. Our sketches take relatable situations and push them to their logical extremes through committed character performances.

### Target Audience
Comedy-savvy viewers ages 25-45 who appreciate both clever wordplay and absurdist commitment. Think fans of "I Think You Should Leave," "Key & Peele," and classic SNL digital shorts.

### Show Personality
- **Smart but accessible** - Clever without being pretentious
- **Committed to the bit** - We fully commit to absurd premises
- **Character-driven** - Funny people in funny situations, not just jokes
- **Grounded escalation** - Starts relatable, escalates to absurd

## Tone & Style

### Overall Tone
**Absurdist-Grounded Hybrid**

We start with recognizable, relatable situations (a job interview, a restaurant meal, a customer service call) and escalate them through character commitment to the absurd. The world feels real even when the behavior doesn't.

### Comedy Styles We Embrace

#### 1. **Character Commitment Comedy**
**Description:** Characters fully believe in their absurd perspectives  
**Example:** A wedding planner who insists every wedding must include a "battle royale" segment because "tradition demands it." They're deadly serious about this insane requirement.  
**Why It Works:** The gap between their seriousness and the absurdity creates comedy.

#### 2. **Escalating Specificity**
**Description:** Premises that get more oddly specific with each beat  
**Example:** A coffee shop barista describing increasingly specific and unnecessary coffee customizations: "That's a grande half-calf, 2% milk, extra hot, no foam, with exactly 3.7 pumps of vanilla, stirred counter-clockwise..."  
**Why It Works:** Specificity is inherently funnier than vagueness.

#### 3. **Systems Taken to Extremes**
**Description:** Real-world systems (corporate, bureaucratic, social) pushed to absurd conclusions  
**Example:** An HR meeting where every minor infraction requires a full tribunal with robed judges and a jury of peers.  
**Why It Works:** Relatable frustrations amplified to cathartic levels.

#### 4. **Mismatched Energy**
**Description:** One character has wildly inappropriate energy for the situation  
**Example:** Someone treating a DMV visit like a high-stakes heist operation, complete with elaborate plans and dramatic music cues they hum themselves.  
**Why It Works:** Energy mismatch creates delightful tension.

### Comedy Styles We Avoid

#### ❌ **Mean-Spirited Punching Down**
**Why:** Comedy should punch up at systems/power, not down at vulnerable people. We don't mock poverty, disability, or marginalized identities for laughs.

#### ❌ **Shock Value Without Purpose**
**Why:** We're not interested in being edgy for edginess' sake. If something shocking appears, it serves the comedy, not just trying to provoke.

#### ❌ **Mugging / Breaking Character**
**Why:** Winking at the audience breaks the spell. Characters must believe in their reality.

#### ❌ **Generic Parody Without Specificity**
**Why:** "Superhero movie" parody is lazy. "The specific trope where they all circle up for the hero shot before the final battle" is specific and funny.

## Content Guidelines

### Topics We Love

#### **Professional Absurdity**
Workplaces, corporate culture, job interviews, performance reviews, team building exercises - all ripe for escalation.

#### **Service Industry Extremes**
Restaurants, customer service, retail, tech support - situations where power dynamics create comedy.

#### **Social Rituals**
Weddings, funerals, parties, dating, family dinners - familiar social situations pushed to breaking points.

#### **Hobby Obsession**
People who take normal hobbies to insane extremes (fantasy football treated like actual warfare, book clubs as cults, etc.).

#### **Modern Life Frustrations**
Technology, bureaucracy, health insurance, customer service phone trees - relatable annoyances amplified.

### Topics We Avoid

#### **Explicit Political Partisan Content**
We're not a political show. Social commentary is fine, but we don't do "Democrats vs Republicans" sketches.

#### **Trauma as Punchline**
Real trauma (sexual assault, child abuse, serious illness) isn't comedy material. We can address these topics with care, but they're not punchlines.

#### **Dated Pop Culture**
No "what if [celebrity from 2 years ago] did [thing]" premises. Cultural references must be either timeless or genuinely current.

### Content Boundaries

#### **Language:** PG-13
- Occasional mild profanity is fine ("damn," "hell," "ass")
- No F-bombs, no C-word, no slurs of any kind
- Humor from words themselves, not just saying bad words

#### **Violence:** Cartoon/Absurdist Only
- Cartoon violence is fine (ACME anvil falling on head)
- Absurdist violence is fine (dramatic slap fight in slow motion)
- No realistic graphic violence
- No realistic weapons

#### **Sexual Content:** Implied, Not Explicit
- Innuendo is fine
- Absurd situations involving sex are fine (couple's therapist who requires homework demonstrations)
- No explicit sexual content or nudity
- Consent is never ambiguous

#### **Sensitive Topics - Extra Care Required**
- **Mental Health:** Can address, but with care. Not dismissive.
- **Addiction:** Not a punchline. Characters can have drinking/drug problems if treated as real.
- **Religion:** Can gently satirize, but not mean-spirited mockery.
- **Race/Gender/Identity:** Can address systems of oppression, can't mock identities.

## Reference Points

### Sketches We Love (Inspiration)

#### **"Baby of the Year" (I Think You Should Leave)**
**Why We Love It:** Complete commitment to an absurd premise. The characters fully believe in a baby beauty pageant with adult stakes. The escalation is perfect—each beat gets bigger. The specificity ("Has this ever happened to you?") is chef's kiss.

**What We Learn:** Commit completely. Make absurd things feel real through specificity and character belief.

---

#### **"Substitute Teacher" (Key & Peele)**
**Why We Love It:** Perfect mismatch energy. One character (teacher) has wildly inappropriate intensity for the situation. Clear game (mispronounces name, escalates when corrected). Each beat heightens perfectly.

**What We Learn:** Simple premises with clear games and escalation work. Character perspective drives everything.

---

#### **"David S. Pumpkins" (SNL)**
**Why We Love It:** Mysterious character with complete confidence. The sketch is essentially "what if someone made NO sense but acted like it was obvious?" The confusion of the straight-man characters creates the comedy.

**What We Learn:** Mystery + confidence = comedy gold. Not everything needs to be explained.

---

#### **"Text Message Confusion" (Key & Peele)**
**Why We Love It:** Takes a relatable situation (misinterpreted text tone) and escalates through specificity and commitment. Each character's imagination gets more elaborate and specific.

**What We Learn:** Start relatable, escalate through imagination and specificity.

---

### Sketches That Aren't Us

#### **Generic Prank/Cringe Humor**
**Why:** We're not interested in watching people genuinely uncomfortable for laughs. Everyone's in on the joke (even if characters aren't).

#### **Sketch as Extended Setup for One Punchline**
**Why:** We need 2-3 laughs per page minimum. Can't coast on one good premise without execution.

#### **"Isn't This Group of People Weird?" Sketches**
**Why:** Observational comedy without a game gets stale fast. Need escalation, not just observation.

---

## Character Types That Work

### **Absurdly Confident Experts**
People with complete confidence in nonsensical expertise (water sommelier, conspiracy theorist detective, motivational speaker with terrible advice).

### **Rule-Followers in Absurd Systems**
Characters who strictly follow insane rules because "that's how it's done" (bureaucrat enforcing nonsense policy, referee of made-up sport).

### **Misplaced Intensity**
Characters with dramatic, high-stakes energy in low-stakes situations (DMV customer treating it like Ocean's Eleven heist).

### **Oblivious Instigators**
Characters who create chaos while remaining cheerful and unaware (party planner whose ideas are disasters, life coach giving terrible advice).

### **Reluctant Participants**
"Straight man" characters forced to engage with insanity (person trying to order coffee from absurdist barista, job interviewee dealing with insane interviewer).

---

## Sketch Length Preferences

### Target Length
**5 pages / 3-4 minutes**

This is the sweet spot for our format. Long enough to establish, escalate, and pay off. Short enough to maintain energy.

### Acceptable Range
- **Minimum:** 3 pages / 2 minutes (for very simple, high-energy premises)
- **Maximum:** 7 pages / 5 minutes (for complex, character-heavy pieces)

### Red Flags
- **Under 3 pages:** Probably too thin to sustain
- **Over 7 pages:** Likely losing momentum, needs tightening

## Success Indicators

### A Great Sketch for Our Show:

#### ✅ **Makes You Laugh Out Loud**
Obvious but critical. If you're not laughing reading it, it's not working.

#### ✅ **Has a Clear "Game"**
You can describe the repeating pattern in one sentence: "Every time the customer orders something normal, the barista makes it absurdly complicated."

#### ✅ **Escalates Properly**
Each beat is bigger than the last. The ending pays off the premise decisively.

#### ✅ **Characters Fully Commit**
No one winks at the camera. Everyone believes in their reality, even when absurd.

#### ✅ **Specific Details Everywhere**
No generic placeholders. Every detail is oddly specific and purposeful.

#### ✅ **Quotable Lines**
At least 2-3 lines you could imagine people repeating.

#### ✅ **Relatable Starting Point**
Even if it ends in absurdity, it starts in something recognizable.

#### ✅ **Doesn't Wear Out the Game**
Ends before the premise gets stale. Leaves you wanting slightly more, not less.

## Evolution & Learning

### How to Update This Bible

As you create sketches and learn what works for your show:

1. **Document patterns that work** - "We realized premises about [X] always work well"
2. **Document patterns that don't** - "We keep trying [Y] but it never lands"
3. **Add new reference sketches** - Build your library of "This is us" examples
4. **Refine boundaries** - Get more specific about what fits your show

### Review Schedule

- **After every 5 sketches:** Quick review - any patterns emerging?
- **Quarterly:** Deep review - update bible with learnings
- **Annually:** Major revision - is the show evolving? Update accordingly.
