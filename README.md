## For Non-Technical Users

### Your Workflow (Simple Version)

#### Before You Start
1. Open `show_bible.md` in any text editor
2. Fill in your show's creative guidelines
3. Save it (this becomes your show's creative DNA)

#### Each Time You Want a New Sketch
1. Open `creative_prompt.md` in text editor
2. Write what you want the sketch to be about
3. Save it
4. Run the system (ask your engineer partner for command)
5. Wait for Checkpoint #1 → Review pitches → Select one
6. Wait for Checkpoint #2 → Review beat sheet → Approve or request changes
7. Wait for Checkpoint #3 → Review final script → Approve or request revision
8. Done! You have a production-ready sketch script

### The Three Files You Edit

**File 1: `show_bible.md`**
- **What:** Your show's style guide
- **Edit when:** Once at setup, then quarterly
- **What to write:** Comedy styles you like, topics you love/avoid, quality standards

**File 2: `creative_prompt.md`**
- **What:** Your sketch idea for this session
- **Edit when:** Every new sketch
- **What to write:** Theme, must-include elements, character types, tone

**File 3: `feedback_template.md`**
- **What:** Your feedback at checkpoints
- **Edit when:** At each checkpoint during workflow
- **What to write:** What you like, what needs fixing, your decision

### Tips for Success

#### Writing Good Creative Prompts
- **Be specific about the core idea**: "Wedding planner who insists all weddings need battle royale" not just "wedding sketch"
- **Include must-have elements**: List 2-3 specific things you want to see
- **Describe the energy**: "Grounded then absurd" or "High-energy throughout"
- **Share inspiration**: "Like that SNL sketch where..." helps agents understand

#### Giving Good Feedback at Checkpoints
- **Be specific**: "The ending feels weak" not "I don't like it"
- **Prioritize**: Mark which notes are critical vs. nice-to-have
- **Explain why**: "This doesn't match our show tone because..."
- **Suggest solutions**: "Maybe try having the character..." not just "fix this"

#### When to Approve vs. Request Changes

**Approve the beat sheet if:**
- The structure makes sense (clear beginning, middle, end)
- The "game" (repeating pattern) is clear
- You can imagine it being funny
- Minor tweaks can happen during drafting

**Request changes if:**
- The structure is confusing
- The "game" isn't clear
- Major elements are missing
- It doesn't match your vision

**Approve the final script if:**
- It makes you laugh (or would make your audience laugh)
- QA score is 80%+ (24/30 checklist items)
- Any remaining issues are minor polish

**Request revision if:**
- It's not funny enough (low joke density)
- Major problems in QA report
- Doesn't match show tone
- Ending is weak

### Don't Worry About

- ❌ Technical stuff (API keys, Python, code)
- ❌ How agents communicate with each other
- ❌ The workflow internals
- ❌ File paths and terminal commands

Your engineer partner handles all technical aspects. You focus on creative direction.

```bash
# Run with debug logging
python run_sketch.py --debug --session "test_001"

# Run specific stage only (for testing)
python run_sketch.py --stage pitch_session --mock-checkpoints

# Run with custom config
python run_sketch.py --show-bible custom_bible.md --prompt custom_prompt.md

# View workflow graph
python -c "from src.workflow.graph import build_workflow_graph; \
           graph = build_workflow_graph(); \
           graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(output_file='workflow.png')"
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_agents.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Test individual agent
python -m pytest tests/test_agents.py::test_senior_writer_a_pitch_generation
```

### Monitoring & Observability

```bash
# Set up LangSmith monitoring
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_key
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=sketch-comedy-agents

# View traces at: https://smith.langchain.com
```

### Deployment Considerations

**Local Development:**
- Use MemorySaver for checkpointing (state in memory)
- Run CLI interface
- Manual human checkpoints

**Production:**
- Use PostgresSaver for persistent checkpointing
- Build web UI for human checkpoints (Flask/FastAPI + React)
- Add authentication for multi-user access
- Queue system for batch processing
- Monitoring dashboard

### Performance Optimization

**Model Selection:**
```python
# agents/config.py
AGENT_MODELS = {
    # Creative leads: Use best model
    "showrunner": "gpt-4",
    "senior_writer_a": "gpt-4",
    "senior_writer_b": "gpt-4",
    
    # Support roles: Use faster model
    "story_editor": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "research": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "script_coordinator": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "qa": "gpt-4",  # QA needs good judgment
}
```

**Caching:**
```python
# Cache show bible (doesn't change often)
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def load_show_bible():
    with open("show_bible.md") as f:
        return f.read()
```

**Parallel Execution:**
```python
# Use asyncio for parallel agent calls
import asyncio

async def pitch_session():
    tasks = [
        staff_writer_a.generate_pitches(state),
        staff_writer_b.generate_pitches(state),
        senior_writer_a.generate_pitches(state),
        senior_writer_b.generate_pitches(state)
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "API Key Not Found"

```
Error: OpenAI API key not found
```

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
2. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` is set correctly
3. Restart terminal/reload environment
4. Verify with: `python -c "import os; print(os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))"`

---

#### Issue: "Module Not Found"

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph'
```

**Solution:**
1. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Verify installation: `pip list | grep langgraph`

---

#### Issue: "Agent Timeout"

```
Error: Agent call timed out after 30 seconds
```

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify API key is valid (not rate-limited)
3. Increase timeout in `src/utils/llm.py`:
   ```python
   llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model, timeout=60)  # Increase to 60s
   ```

---

#### Issue: "Checkpoint Not Found"

```
Error: Could not resume workflow - checkpoint not found
```

**Solution:**
1. If using MemorySaver: State is lost after restart (expected)
2. If using PostgresSaver: Check database connection
3. Start fresh session: `python run_sketch.py --new-session`

---

#### Issue: "Poor Quality Output"

**Symptoms:** Agents produce generic/weak content

**Solution:**
1. **Improve show_bible.md**: Add more specific examples and guidelines
2. **Improve creative_prompt.md**: Be more specific about what you want
3. **Adjust prompts**: Edit `prompts/agent_prompts.md` with better examples
4. **Change models**: Try GPT-4 for all agents (higher cost, better quality)
5. **Increase temperature**: In `src/utils/llm.py`, try `temperature=0.8`

---

#### Issue: "Revision Loop"

**Symptoms:** System stuck in endless revision cycles

**Solution:**
1. Check `MAX_REVISION_CYCLES` in `.env` (should be 3)
2. Verify Showrunner approval logic in `src/agents/showrunner.py`
3. Lower quality threshold temporarily for testing
4. Add debug logging to see why approval fails

---

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run with verbose logging
python run_sketch.py --debug

# Output shows:
# 🔍 [DEBUG] Loading show bible from: show_bible.md
# 🔍 [DEBUG] Loaded 2,347 characters
# 🔍 [DEBUG] Initializing Staff Writer A agent...
# 🔍 [DEBUG] Calling LLM with prompt (1,234 tokens)...
# 🔍 [DEBUG] Received response (567 tokens)
# 🔍 [DEBUG] Parsed 3 pitches from response
# ... etc
```

## Costs & Performance

### Estimated Costs per Sketch

Based on OpenAI API pricing (as of Feb 2026):

**Configuration: GPT-4 for creative, GPT-3.5 for support**

| Stage | Agents | Tokens (avg) | Cost |
|-------|--------|--------------|------|
| Pitch Session | 4 creative | ~8,000 | $0.24 |
| Story Breaking | 3 creative + 2 support | ~12,000 | $0.36 |
| Drafting | 2 creative + 2 support | ~15,000 | $0.45 |
| Table Read | 4 creative + 2 support | ~10,000 | $0.30 |
| Revision (1 cycle) | 2 creative + 1 support | ~8,000 | $0.24 |
| Polish | 2 support | ~3,000 | $0.06 |
| **Total per sketch** | | **~56,000** | **$1.65** |

**With 2 revision cycles:** ~$2.13 per sketch  
**With 3 revision cycles:** ~$2.61 per sketch

**Monthly cost estimates:**
- 5 sketches/month: $8-13
- 10 sketches/month: $16-26
- 20 sketches/month: $33-52

**Configuration: GPT-4 for all agents** (highest quality):
- ~$2.80 per sketch
- 10 sketches/month: ~$28

**Configuration: GPT-3.5 for all agents** (fastest/cheapest):
- ~$0.28 per sketch
- 10 sketches/month: ~$2.80

### Time Performance

**Average sketch generation time:** 55-90 minutes

| Stage | Time |
|-------|------|
| Pitch Session | 5-10 min |
| Human Review #1 | 2-3 min |
| Story Breaking | 10-15 min |
| Human Review #2 | 3-5 min |
| Drafting | 15-20 min |
| Table Read | 10-15 min |
| Revision (1x) | 10-20 min |
| Polish | 5-10 min |
| Human Review #3 | 3-5 min |

**Parallelization improvements:**
- Pitch session: 4 agents in parallel → 7-8 min (vs. 28-32 min sequential)
- Table read: 6 agents in parallel → 10-15 min (vs. 60-90 min sequential)

**Bottlenecks:**
1. LLM API response time (network latency)
2. Human review time (depends on human availability)
3. Token generation speed (model-dependent)

### Optimization Strategies

**For Speed:**
1. Use GPT-3.5 for support agents (2x faster)
2. Implement caching for unchanged content
3. Reduce revision cycles (accept earlier)
4. Batch multiple sketch sessions

**For Cost:**
1. Use GPT-3.5 for all agents ($0.28/sketch)
2. Reduce max tokens per agent call
3. Implement prompt compression
4. Cache research results across sketches

**For Quality:**
1. Use GPT-4 for all agents ($2.80/sketch)
2. Increase revision cycles to 3
3. Add quality filters before human review
4. Enhance agent prompts with better examples
