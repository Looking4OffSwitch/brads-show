# Show Bible: Silicon Silly

This document defines the creative guidelines for your show.

## Show Identity

### Show Name
Silicon Silly

### What's This Show About?
A sketch comedy show that parodies the absurdities of Silicon Valley startup culture. From impossible pitch meetings to delusional founders who think their app will "change the world," we explore the gap between tech industry self-importance and reality. Think "The Office" meets "Silicon Valley" but in sketch form.

### Target Audience
Adults 25-45 who work in tech or adjacent industries, fans of shows like Silicon Valley, The Office, and Veep. People who enjoy smart satire that punches up at corporate culture and tech industry excess.

### Show Personality

- Satirical but affectionate - we mock because we understand
- Grounded absurdism - real situations taken to logical extremes
- Character-driven - the comedy comes from specific people, not just concepts
- Smart but accessible - you don't need to code to find it funny
- Escalating specificity - details that get increasingly ridiculous

---

## Tone & Style

### Overall Tone
Smart satire with a warm underbelly. We're making fun of the tech industry, but in a way that feels like insider jokes rather than mean-spirited attacks. The comedy comes from recognition - audiences should think "I've been in that meeting" or "I know that guy." Grounded in reality but willing to escalate to absurdity.

### Comedy Styles We Embrace

#### Style 1: Escalating Commitment
**Description:** Characters who double down on obviously flawed premises, digging deeper holes with each beat.
**Example:** A founder explaining why their pivot from food delivery to "decentralized emotion tokens" actually makes perfect sense, getting more confident as the explanation gets more ridiculous.
**Why it works:** Tech culture rewards confidence over competence, so characters who embody this are instantly recognizable.

#### Style 2: Jargon Overload
**Description:** Using real tech buzzwords in increasingly absurd combinations until the language becomes meaningless.
**Example:** "We're leveraging AI-powered blockchain solutions to disrupt the synergy-adjacent wellness space."
**Why it works:** The tech industry actually talks like this, so we're just holding up a mirror.

#### Style 3: The Mundane Made Epic
**Description:** Treating ordinary office situations with the gravity of life-or-death stakes.
**Example:** A Slack message about snacks in the break room delivered like a presidential address.
**Why it works:** Startups really do treat everything like it's world-changing, which is inherently funny.

### Comedy Styles We Avoid

#### Mean-spirited punching down
**Why:** We mock systems and archetypes, not vulnerable individuals. No jokes at the expense of junior employees, interns, or people struggling financially.

#### Dated references
**Why:** Tech moves fast. No jokes about MySpace or flip phones unless there's a reason.

#### Pure absurdism without grounding
**Why:** The comedy works because it's rooted in real experiences. Random weirdness isn't our style.

## Content Guidelines

### Topics We Love

- Pitch meetings and investor relations - the theater of fundraising
- Company culture gone wrong - mandatory fun, wellness theater, values statements
- Product development delusions - features nobody asked for
- Founder psychology - the specific breed of confidence/delusion
- Remote work absurdities - Zoom fatigue, Slack overload
- Tech jargon and buzzword bingo - the language of saying nothing

### Topics We Avoid

- Specific real companies by name - we're satirizing the culture, not attacking individuals
- Coding jokes that require deep technical knowledge - accessible to non-engineers
- Crypto/NFT content that's already dated - unless there's a fresh angle
- Political content that's not directly about tech culture

### Content Boundaries

#### Language
Mild profanity okay (damn, hell, occasional stronger word for emphasis). Keep it workplace-adjacent - nothing you couldn't say in an HBO show.

#### Violence
Cartoon/metaphorical only. No actual violence. "This meeting is killing me" type humor is fine.

#### Sexual Content
Innuendo and dating app jokes are fine. Nothing explicit. Awkward workplace romance situations okay.

#### Sensitive Topics
Job loss should be handled with some humanity - losing your job isn't the punchline. Mental health in tech is fair game but not mockingly.

## Reference Points

### Sketches/Shows We Love (Inspiration)

#### Silicon Valley (HBO)
**Why we love it:** Perfect capture of founder delusion and tech culture specifics.
**What we learn from it:** Ground absurdity in real details. Jian-Yang's "not hotdog" app is funny because it's SO specific.

#### I Think You Should Leave (Netflix)
**Why we love it:** Commitment to the bit, characters who refuse to back down.
**What we learn from it:** Let characters dig their own graves. Don't bail them out.

#### The Office (both versions)
**Why we love it:** Finding comedy in mundane workplace moments.
**What we learn from it:** Specificity of character and setting. David Brent's specific delusions, not generic boss behavior.

#### Veep
**Why we love it:** Rapid-fire smart dialogue, characters who are competent at being incompetent.
**What we learn from it:** Everyone thinks they're the hero of their own story.

### What's NOT Us

- Family Guy style cutaway gags - we stay in the scene
- Broad slapstick - we're not falling down
- Impression-based celebrity humor - we create our own characters
- "Tech is bad" moralizing - we're not lecturing, we're laughing

## Character Types That Work

### The True Believer Founder
Absolutely convinced their app will change humanity. Cannot process negative feedback. Speaks in TED Talk cadences. References Steve Jobs often.

### The Exhausted Middle Manager
Just trying to keep things running while leadership pivots every week. Eye-rolls at every all-hands meeting. Has seen 12 "once in a lifetime opportunities."

### The Over-Eager New Hire
Drank all the Kool-Aid. Treats free snacks like a religious experience. Will definitely burn out in 8 months.

### The Checked-Out Senior Engineer
Has been here since the garage days. Knows where all the bodies are buried. Does the minimum to vest their options.

### The HR Person Who's Seen Everything
Unflappable. Has processed so many "culture incidents" that nothing surprises them. Speaks in careful corporate language.

### The VC Bro
Talks about "thesis" and "dry powder." Has never built anything but has strong opinions about everything. Refers to companies as "plays."

## Sketch Preferences

### Target Length
4-6 pages (3-5 minutes performed). Long enough to establish and escalate, short enough to not overstay welcome.

### Structural Preferences
- Establish normal, introduce the game, three escalations, blow/button
- Characters should want something specific
- The game should be clear by page 2

### Ending Style
Strong buttons preferred - either a callback that recontextualizes everything, or an escalation so big it can only end there. Avoid trailing off.
