# Creative Prompt

## Core Idea (Required)

A startup founder gives a pitch to VCs that starts normal but gradually reveals their "revolutionary AI assistant" is just a guy named Gary who lives in the server room and answers questions through a chat interface. The founder is completely oblivious that this isn't AI, and Gary occasionally breaks character to complain about working conditions.

### What Sparked This
The AI hype is so intense that I wondered: what if someone just... faked it? And what if they were so deep in startup delusion that they didn't even realize they were faking it?

---

## Specific Requirements (Optional)

### Must Include

- The phrase "proprietary neural architecture" used to describe Gary
- A moment where Gary clearly types something personal ("brb bathroom") and the founder spins it as "the AI is learning human behavior patterns"
- At least one VC who starts to figure it out but gets shut down by other VCs who are too excited
- Gary's typing speed being described as "organic latency - it feels more human"

### Characters

- CHAD - The founder. True believer. Stanford dropout. Patagonia vest. Has never questioned whether Gary is actually AI.
- GARY - A tired man in his 40s who answered a Craigslist ad. Types responses to queries. Getting increasingly fed up.
- VICTORIA - Senior VC partner. Skeptical but being pressured by her firm to "not miss the next AI play."
- MARCUS - Junior VC. Desperately wants to believe. Writes things down even when Chad says nonsense.
- DEREK - VC partner who keeps almost figuring it out but gets talked over.

### Setting
A sleek conference room at a VC firm. We occasionally cut to Gary in a dingy server closet with a folding chair and a keyboard.

### Tone for This Sketch
Starts grounded and builds to absurdity. The humor comes from Chad's absolute certainty colliding with Gary's increasingly visible humanity.

## What I'm Hoping For (Optional)

I want the audience to experience the same journey as the skeptical VC - slowly realizing something is very wrong while everyone else barrels ahead. The ending should make clear that this is going to get funded anyway, commenting on how hype trumps due diligence.

---

## What to Avoid (Optional)

- Don't make Gary sympathetic to the point of it being sad - he's in on a con, he's just tired of it
- Don't make the VCs completely stupid - they're smart people who WANT to believe
- Avoid any suggestion that real AI doesn't exist - the joke is about THIS company, not the industry

---

## Inspiration References (Optional)

- The blood testing company Theranos and the willful blindness of investors
- Silicon Valley's "not hotdog" app episode
- The way AI demos often feel slightly too polished
