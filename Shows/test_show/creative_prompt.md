# Creative Prompt

## Core Idea (Required)

A tech support agent who treats basic computer problems like he's performing life-saving surgery, complete with dramatic countdowns, sterile environment requirements, and emotional speeches to the computer.

### What Sparked This
I was on hold with tech support for 2 hours yesterday and thought "what if they took this WAY too seriously?"

---

## Specific Requirements

### Must Include
- The classic "have you tried turning it off and on again?" line delivered with intense drama
- At least one moment where the tech support agent asks the customer to "scrub in"
- The computer must be referred to as "the patient"

### Characters
- Tech support agent with surgeon-level intensity (main character)
- Confused customer who just wants their printer to work (straight man)
- Optional: Another tech support agent acting as "surgical nurse" handing tools

### Setting
- Customer's home office (they're on video call)
- Tech support agent has transformed their cubicle into a mock operating room

### Tone for This Sketch
More grounded at first (normal tech support call) escalating to fully absurd (wearing scrubs, using medical instruments to "diagnose" the computer).

---

## What I'm Hoping For

A sketch that:
- Makes fun of how seriously tech support can take minor problems
- Has clear escalation from normal to absurd
- Features lots of medical jargon misapplied to computers
- Ends with a satisfying button (probably the solution is embarrassingly simple)

---

## What to Avoid

- Don't make the customer too dumb (they should be reasonable)
- Don't actually mock real tech support workers (we're exaggerating for comedy, not being mean)
- Keep it in the PG-13 zone (no actual gore/blood)

---

## Additional Notes

This could be a great showcase for physical comedy if the agent is miming surgery while on video call. Lots of opportunities for callbacks to "surgical" elements.

Possible escalation path:
1. Starts relatively normal tech support
2. Agent asks customer to "prep the patient"
3. Agent starts using medical language ("We're losing connection! I need bandwidth, STAT!")
4. Agent recruits customer as "surgical assistant"
5. Dramatic moment when solution is found (probably just restarting)

Possible titles: "Tech Support ER" or "The PC Doctor" or "Code Blue Screen"
