## Show Identity

### Show Name
Test Show

### What's This Show About?
A sketch comedy show that finds humor in everyday workplace absurdity. We take recognizable office situations and push them to their logical extremes through committed character performances and escalating stakes.

### Target Audience
Comedy-savvy viewers ages 25-45 who appreciate both clever wordplay and absurdist commitment. Think fans of "I Think You Should Leave," "Key & Peele," and "The Office."

### Show Personality
- Smart but accessible - Clever without being pretentious
- Committed to the bit - We fully commit to absurd premises
- Character-driven - Funny people in funny situations, not just jokes
- Grounded escalation - Starts relatable, escalates to absurd
- Quotable - Lines people will repeat to their friends

## Tone & Style

### Overall Tone
**Absurdist-Grounded Hybrid**

We start with recognizable, relatable situations (a job interview, a restaurant meal, a customer service call) and escalate them through character commitment to the absurd. The world feels real even when the behavior doesn't.

### Comedy Styles We Embrace

#### Style 1: Character Commitment Comedy
**Description:** Characters fully believe in their absurd perspectives
**Example:** A wedding planner who insists every wedding must include a "battle royale" segment because "tradition demands it." They're deadly serious about this insane requirement.
**Why it works:** The gap between their seriousness and the absurdity creates comedy.

#### Style 2: Escalating Specificity
**Description:** Premises that get more oddly specific with each beat
**Example:** A coffee shop barista describing increasingly specific and unnecessary coffee customizations.
**Why it works:** Specificity is inherently funnier than vagueness.

#### Style 3: Systems Taken to Extremes
**Description:** Real-world systems (corporate, bureaucratic, social) pushed to absurd conclusions
**Example:** An HR meeting where every minor infraction requires a full tribunal with robed judges.
**Why it works:** Relatable frustrations amplified to cathartic levels.

#### Style 4: Mismatched Energy
**Description:** One character has wildly inappropriate energy for the situation
**Example:** Someone treating a DMV visit like a high-stakes heist operation.
**Why it works:** Energy mismatch creates delightful tension.

### Comedy Styles We Avoid

#### Mean-Spirited Punching Down
**Why:** Comedy should punch up at systems/power, not down at vulnerable people.

#### Shock Value Without Purpose
**Why:** We're not interested in being edgy for edginess' sake.

#### Mugging / Breaking Character
**Why:** Winking at the audience breaks the spell. Characters must believe in their reality.

## Content Guidelines

### Topics We Love
- Professional absurdity - Workplaces, corporate culture, job interviews, performance reviews
- Service industry extremes - Restaurants, customer service, retail, tech support
- Social rituals - Weddings, parties, dating, family dinners pushed to breaking points
- Hobby obsession - People who take normal hobbies to insane extremes
- Modern life frustrations - Technology, bureaucracy, customer service phone trees

### Topics We Avoid
- Explicit political partisan content - We're not a political show
- Trauma as punchline - Real trauma isn't comedy material
- Dated pop culture - No "what if [celebrity from 2 years ago] did [thing]"

### Content Boundaries

#### Language
PG-13. Occasional mild profanity is fine ("damn," "hell," "ass"). No F-bombs or slurs.

#### Violence
Cartoon/absurdist only. Dramatic slap fights in slow motion are fine. No realistic graphic violence.

#### Sexual Content
Innuendo is fine. Absurd situations involving romance are fine. No explicit content.

#### Sensitive Topics
Mental health can be addressed with care, not dismissively. Religion can be gently satirized but not mocked. Race/gender/identity - can address systems of oppression, can't mock identities.

## Reference Points

### Sketches/Shows We Love (Inspiration)

#### "Baby of the Year" (I Think You Should Leave)
**Why we love it:** Complete commitment to an absurd premise. The characters fully believe in a baby beauty pageant with adult stakes.
**What we learn from it:** Commit completely. Make absurd things feel real through specificity.

#### "Substitute Teacher" (Key & Peele)
**Why we love it:** Perfect mismatch energy. Clear game that escalates perfectly.
**What we learn from it:** Simple premises with clear games and escalation work.

#### "David S. Pumpkins" (SNL)
**Why we love it:** Mysterious character with complete confidence. Not everything needs to be explained.
**What we learn from it:** Mystery + confidence = comedy gold.

### What's NOT Us
- Generic prank/cringe humor - Everyone's in on the joke
- Sketches as extended setup for one punchline - We need 2-3 laughs per page minimum
- "Isn't this group of people weird?" observational comedy without escalation

## Character Types That Work

### Absurdly Confident Experts
People with complete confidence in nonsensical expertise (water sommelier, conspiracy theorist detective).

### Rule-Followers in Absurd Systems
Characters who strictly follow insane rules because "that's how it's done."

### Misplaced Intensity
Characters with dramatic, high-stakes energy in low-stakes situations.

### Oblivious Instigators
Characters who create chaos while remaining cheerful and unaware.

### Reluctant Participants
"Straight man" characters forced to engage with insanity.

---

## Sketch Preferences

### Target Length
5 pages / 3-4 minutes. Long enough to establish, escalate, and pay off. Short enough to maintain energy.

### Structural Preferences
- Start grounded, escalate to absurd
- Clear "game" that repeats with variations
- Three escalations minimum before the button

### Ending Style
Strong button preferred. Callbacks welcome. No fade-outs or "just ends" - give us a decisive ending.
